          Just after turning 40, I turned another milestone: I decided to quit Companies in order to start a new path in the world of 
          tesching at the beginning of Nov 2021. 
          This decision can make one turn up one's nose: I consider it stimulating and extremely enriching. 
          <br />I teach <em>Computer Science</em>in high schools: I was at Istituto MosÃ© Bianchi in Monza during school year 2021-2022,
          teaching in AFM (Administration, Finance and Marketing) and CAT (Buildings, Environment and Territory) for standard daily school as well
          as for evening school for adults and prison school. Many experiences with different people: I learn something from each of them!
          <br />I'm at <a href="https://www.mapelli-monza.edu.it/" target="_blank" class="fancyLink">Istituto Achille Mapelli</a> in Monza for school year 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, teaching mainly to High School for Scientific Studies - 
          Applied Sciences.
          <br />In addition to school courses, I had the pleasure of training teens and teachers on various platforms (like Arduino, mBot, Lego Spike)
          both internally and in other school thanks to the collaboration with 
          <a href="https://edulia.it/" target="_blank" class="fancyLink">Edulia - Treccani</a> and taking care, among others, of the school website.

          For sure some pros are important aspects which shaped my job too: flexibility, curiosity and fast error / learning and development process in all business area, 
          from marketing to sales, from contents creation to customer support. 
		      <br>I was lucky enough to live those crazy years learning and rooting an even stronger human and working ethics despite the progress of a global economic
