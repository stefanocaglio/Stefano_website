          I'm the Tech Manager of the Trotec Laser subsidiary in Italy. Beside all the management and other important parts of my job, including implementing new products and strategies, budgeting, team scheduling while using state of the art tools such as SAP and SalesForce,
		  the most rewarding moments are when I can make people exclaim ðŸ’¡<em>I got it</em>ðŸ’¡. A customer, a colleague, a trainee who can have an Eureka! moment and connect dots is what makes my day. 
		  <br>Going behind all the bells and whistles, back to the roots, to the very <strong>simplest and clearest</strong> concepts and ideas is what I believe is most needed nowadays. 
		  <br>If you can express yourself simply and clearly you can be understood. If you can be understood you are trustworthy. And this is a good environment to build good relationships, of any kind.

		  <br>Processes automation is the aim of these kind of tools. We are using technology so that all value chain actors, both customers and suppliers, can share knowledge to make better, faster and more clever choices and decisions.

          While ending my MSc I started working in my family-run company, Porta & C., in order to develop the distribution channel of <a href="https://www.troteclaser.com/en-us/">Trotec laser</a> systems in Italy. Being a very small structure has its pros and cons. For sure some pros are important aspects which shaped my job too: flexibility, curiosity and fast error / learning and development process in all business area, from marketing to sales, from contents creation to customer support. 
		  <br>I was lucky enough to live those crazy years learning and rooting an even stronger human and working ethics despite the progress of a global economic transformation which led to the acquisition of Porta by <a href="https://www.trodat-trotec.com/en/">Trodat-Trotec Group</a>.
		  <br>Being more technical-oriented, those years were a deep dive training into what's needed to run and get a succesful commercial business with sparkling creativity, limited resources and inspiring relationships.

          BSc at the Politecnico di Milano with a major in space engineering. This is where I first came in contact with actual space programs while working at my thesis as an intern for Carlo Gavazzi Space (now <a href="https://www.ohb-italia.it/">OHB Italia</a>), developing system level thermal models for <a href="https://ams02.space/what-is-ams/ams-in-nutshell">AMS-02</a>.
		  <br>AMS-02 is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station (ISS), where it was installed on 19-May-2011 by Space Shuttle Endeavour <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/main/index.html">STS-134</a> specialists  and where it's going to be until the ISS end of life thanks to maintenance and updated done mainly during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kz9p3iKKpxo?rel=0">2019 spacewalks</a>. It takes advantages of the unique space environment to study the universe and its origin by searching for antimatter and dark matter while performing precision measurements of cosmic rays composition and flux.

        <div class="pico"><img src="./Stefano Caglio_files/flight.jpg"></div>
        <div class="pdesc"><strong>Flight</strong> is one of my biggest passions since I was a child! Despite my ophthalmologist always told me I would have never be a pilot, I got my ultralight pilot license back in 2002. Honestly I didn't kept it active due to personal reasons and right now is one of the item in the topmost part of my to-do (again) list! Technical aspects are important as emotional ones: both imply to look at the world we are used to from a different point of view.</div>

        <div class="pdesc">The same reasons, along with the fact it's hard to me to sunbath for too long, led me <strong>scuba diving</strong>. Water, saltie or not, is such a different and beautiful environment! I fell in love so <em>deeply</em> that I attended all the courses until becoming a PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor in 2010. Even if my full time job left me short time for teaching people to go underwater and travelling, this is something important on the list too!</div>

        <div class="pdesc"> <strong>Running</strong>, <strong>trail running</strong> and <strong>trekking</strong> in our Alps or just strolling in the Royal Villa of Monza park delighted by colors of different seasons are all activities that free my mind and regenerate my body. Spending time surrounded by nature's colors and sounds (water sound is my favourite!) is an actual panacea to me!</div>

Along the years, I moved to electric guitar and played in several bands: from the to most ironic to the heaviest, I always love to use heavy distorted sounds, playing with many pedals and dealing with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_buying_disorder#Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome_(G.A.S.)">GAS</a>. Even if I'm playing only in my house now, it's always a pleasure and a creative moment!</div>

The first one is a modular structure for expositive spaces ceiling, <a href="https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/848734/87462/unonessunofull.pdf#page=150">Smart Pavilion</a> designed by my friend <a href="https://manuelromeoarchitetto.it/">Manuel Romeo</a> for PhyCoLab (Physical Computing Laboratory) of Politecico di Milano.

		The second one is a project using piezoelectric materials from a renewable energy point of view. </div>

I started around 2014 using a fully discretional approach to investing and trading, switching over time to a more data driven and quantitative approach. This has led me to better understand markets like stocks, futures, currencies, cryptos and to deepen my knowledge in tools like R and Python. I know this is a very challenging and always changing world: I'm just scratching its the surface but it's rewarding in itself.</div>
